Base classes and class factory classes which provide standard behaviors
(immutability of all attributes after initialization, concealment of all
non-public attributes from ``dir``) by default. Can apply additional decorators
and can tune for selective or total mutability or visibility. Enforce on class
attributes and instance attributes.
